## Training at Becode.org (jan - oct 2021)

> As part of our training at Becode, we had to create a contact form.
> This is a solo consolidation challenge for 3 days (22-23-24/03) hosted on Github & a private website.

## The mission

> The company Hackers Poulette ™ sells Raspberry Pi accessory kits to build your own.
> They want to allow their users to contact their support team.
> Your mission is to create a fully-functioning online "contact support" form, in PHP.
> It must display a contact form and process the received answer (sanitize, validate, answer the user).

## Instructions

> Must have:

- the project repository must include a low-fidelity mock-up
- the form's html code must be semantically valid
- the HTML must be accessible to blind people
- in case of wrong input, the form should display a useful visual clue about the error
- display the error message near the correct input field
- the error message must be readable (helpful to users)
- the form has to be sanitised and validated (server side)
- if all required inputs are valid, the script should respond by email to a given address
- implement a honeypot anti spam technique.

> Optional:

- client side validation with JavaScript
- work on a good and clear user experience (UX)
- respond to the user request with Ajax

## Preliminary preparation
